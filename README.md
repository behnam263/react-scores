# `react-scores` project

This project contains a simple example of a react application for recording the scored you got with your exams.

It will be developed in phases, in several weeks, to illustrate the different features of the framework.

* Phase 1: just static component rendering, and props-propagation. Uses 'fake' data and does not allow any user interaction.
